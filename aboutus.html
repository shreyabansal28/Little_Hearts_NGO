      <div class="About">

        <img src="https://www.daughterofmoon.com/images/new-imagesnew1/banner-slider1.jpg" id="child" style="width:500px;height:300px;margin-left:15px;">

      "LITTLE HEARTS" is a vision for our team.An organisation through which we want to give back lost smiles,motivations,and hope for better tomorrow to everyone.Life,as we know,hasn't been easy for anyone at any point in time.However,for a few,it has been far difficult with a lack of available resources.We started in 2016 eagerly looking forward to helping as many children as we can to make a change in their lives.
     </br>
      Our Country is the second most populated one in the worldwith millions of people living below poverty line.As much as we would love our government to help each one out there,it is not practically possible to do it with many more important decisions to be taken everyday.The lack of immediate attention on a few makes them feel neglected,less cared for,or hopeless.This was our problem to tackle providing immediate support to as many children as possible.We want every child to feel included,cared for,and loved beacause there emotions deserve equality.Don't they? </br>
      <img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1450ac7bbd49dca841f0fcb32492828d"style="width:500px;height:300px;margin-left:15px;">
      Another question that arises in our minds is why education is so important for these Children?It helps them become better citizens,get a better-paid job,shows the difference between good and bad.Education shows us the importance of hardwork and,at the same time,helps us grow and develop.Thus,we are able to shape a better society to live in by knowing and respecting rights,laws,regulations.</br>
      On average,poor children also experience more developmental delays,emotional problems,and lower academic achievement.A growing body of research now shows that poverty changes the way children's brains develop,shrinking parts of the brain essential for memory,planning,and decision-making.</br>
      Our organization will help to provide basic needs to children to go school without any interruption.We provide books,school uniforms,notebooks,travelcharges and healthcare.
    </br>
    Now the next question we come across is why should we help underprivileged children?
    We have to help them because if they are not educated they won't become better citizens of this country.They are not going to understand that even they have a RIGHT TO EDUCATION and no one is going to aware them about their rights and duties.They can't afford to go to school that's why they need our help and we can contibute in some or the other way.</br>

      EDUCATION is the best gift you can give to a child.If they SMILE because of you for any reason,ever once,consider it the best achievement you could have ever achieved.What is better than helping children (FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY)who can't afford education? 'LITTLE HEARTS' as an organisation wants to spread sesitivity towards everything possible,more humanity,and a happier tomorrow.Will you join hands with us to make this earth a better place for living?
