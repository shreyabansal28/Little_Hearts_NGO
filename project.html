               <strong> LITTLE HEART</strong> Foundation, an NGO for poor child education, is an NGO in India directly benefitting over 15,00,000 children and their families every year, through more than 400 live welfare projects on education, healthcare, livelihood and women empowerment, in over 2000 remote villages and slums across 25 states of India.<br><br>

                Education is both the means as well as the end to a better life: the means because it empowers an individual to earn his/her livelihood and the end because it increases one's awareness on a range of issues – from healthcare to appropriate social behaviour to understanding one's rights – and in the process help him/her evolve as a better citizen.<br><br>
                
                Doubtless, education is the most powerful catalyst for social transformation. But child education cannot be done in isolation. A child will go to school only if the family, particularly the mother, is assured of healthcare and empowered. Moreover, when an elder sibling is relevantly skilled to be employable and begins earning, the journey of empowerment continues beyond the present generation.

       a national level development organization that was established in 2019  as a part of their giving back to the society.Little hearts  works on the subjects of education, healthcare, livelihood and women empowerment through 185 projects operational across 25 states in India. He comes from a background where volunteerism comes naturally from school days. So doing social good in one or other way always remain in the back of the mind. At present, Little Hearts has 74 Mission Education projects functional across India. 
       <br>
       The realization of a group of young corporate professionals, that it was their Social Responsibility to give back to the society, laid the foundation of Little Hearts. I had come to Delhi for making a career and earning a livelihood.  when liberalization happened, we were the first ones to get the fruit of success beyond expectation. My needs are limited. The very thought of doing something beyond just professional gain started haunting me always. I brought in a group of likeminded friends to start discussing what and how to do something which can impact maximum lives with our limited understanding and resources. As you know, wherever you look at in our country, there is so much to do in terms of development and nothing would look sufficient.

On a larger picture,Little Hearts has been trying since it’s inception in 2002 to develop efficient and accountable models in project management, bringing multiplier effect in social development, and involving civil society as partners in the development process.
